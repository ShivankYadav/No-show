Exploratory Data Analysis.
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.
We will analyse the Dataset to find what factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
A detailed description is in the jupyter notebook.
